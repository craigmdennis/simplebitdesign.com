            %p Rail Modeller is a an OSX application and as such <b>doens't have a linear flow</b>. We worked to <b>simplify the interactions</b> required to produce complex interaction. Examples include choosing a part library, picking a track piece and setting a gradient. We split the canvas into an (optional) orthographic view to give context.

            %p We introcuced a more <b>consistent menu system with iconography</b> that more <b>clearly indicated</b> the action which it represents. We used graphics programs as the basis as the tasks are fairly similar. We reduced any misinterpresation by introducing tooltips with links to relevant sections in the help.

            %p One of the key areas that needed improvement was the invetory; the area where users can collate the pieces they have used while building.
            %p We made it <b>simple and straight-forward</b> to toggle between specific information about the canvas as well as give users the ability to create a shopping list and export <b>using conventional OSX interface elements</b>; the goal being to make the application <b>more accessible to non-technical people</b>.
